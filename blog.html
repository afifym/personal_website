            First and foremost, I love to code, moreover, I love to design, ever
            since I found my passion in code and design I have been looking for
            ways to combine both, and that's where frontend comes into play.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always think of building frontend web pages as making a PowerPoint
            presentation, at the end of the day both are used to effectively
            tell a story or deliver a message except that web pages directly
            interact with the audience and their actions and removes the need
            for a presenter, this idea among many others are fascinating to me
            and I'm in love with the concept and obsessed with the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a never-ending thirst to build beautiful websites and I'm
            hungry to sink my teeth into a new adventure where I use the power
            of programming combined with my life experiences to provide value to
            the people around the world and I'm passionately moving towards this
            goal.
